Version 2025090x.1 has few visible changes but a couple of major
internal ones:

1.  Timestamp calculation modified so that wraparound will not happen
for about 68 years.

2.  Fixes for the print functions to avoid some display errors that
occurred when the timestamp became very large.

3.  These fixes should improve measurement speeds.  Synthesized tests
show about 230 pairs of timestamps per second; real world will be
somewhat less than that.

4.  Fixes to a fundamental problem processing interrupts generated by
the TDC7200 chips that used to use an ugly hack that had some effect on
the maximum measurement rate.  How much this helps has not yet been
tested, but it's a much improved approach.

5.  If you do want to wrap timestamps at some fixed value (like 100
seconds), that can now be enabled in the startup configuration menu.
